!(a || b) => !a && !b
!(a && b) => !a || !b

Are the following two statements equivalent?
A = !(xb <= yb && !p)
B = xb > yb || p

It looks like we have the following types -
xb, yb numbers
p, boolean

A = !(xb <= yb && !p) How can we use DM?

Well, we want to match this form -
!(a && b) => !a || !b

In our case,
a = (xb <= yb)
!a = xb > yb
and
b = !p
!b = p
so,
(!a || !b) <=> (xb > yb) || p
Now, we can use it.

A = !(xb <= yb && !p)
  = xb > yb || p
B = xb > yb || p
