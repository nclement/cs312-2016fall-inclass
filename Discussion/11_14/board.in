how do we know if we have a streak going diagonally down,
starting at a point i, j
i+0,j+0 is a hash
i+1,j+1 is a hash
i+2,j+2 is a hash
i+3,j+3 is a hash

k 0 to 3 inclusive
i+k,j+k is not a hash OR out of bounds, return false
return true

i/j 0   1   2
0   .   .   .
1   .   .   .
2   .   .   .

i refers to the row, j refers to the col
i,j
i+1,j => moves down one row
i-1,j => moves up one row
i,j+1 => moves right one col
i,j-1 => moves left one col
