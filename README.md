# CS312 In-Class Examples #
## Fall 2016 ##

I'll try and post all the example code I go over in class to this repo. This
way,
 1. I'll be able to update it easily (especially during class), and
 2. You (the student) will be able to get a flavor for how people in the real-
    world share code.


It *is* possible that I will edit this code after class (when talking about it
during office hours), but the changes I make should be minimal and positive.

## Directory Structure ##
* In the folder `Demo` are the majority of my code samples for class.
* In the folder `Graphics` are all the classes that require the use of `DrawingPanel.java`.
